    <h1> How to make the best Cheesecake!</h1> <p></p>

    For a recipe with so few ingredients 
    (cream cheese, eggs, sugar, sour cream, vanilla & salt), 
    it took a lot longer than you might think to develop the 
    perfect version. 
    I’ve shared a few cheesecake variations in the past, 
    including my No-Bake Cheesecake, 
    but getting a perfected classic version took lots of testing. 
    Finally, here we are.
